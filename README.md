# Omarchy CachyOS

Turn a fresh CachyOS installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

*Since for some reason Omarchy dev doesn't like Arch-based distros, I decided to make slight modifications and my own adjustments to the installer - removed junk, adapted several steps for CachyOS and added some lines for my own setup.*
